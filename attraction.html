                    <p align="justify"> Panch Mahal, a five storeyed pavilion, stands on the western line of the courtyard. This is the badgir, the Persian wind tower for ladies of the harem. The jail screens between the 176 differently carved pillars have disappeared. Once these screens provided purdah (cover) to queens and princess on the top terraces enjoying the cool breezes and watching splendid views of Sikri fortifications and the town nestling at the foot of the ridge. <br>
                    
Built by Akbar, the architecture of Panch Mahal was inspired by that of a Buddhist temple. Akbar essentially used the Panch Mahal for his relaxation and entertainment. The structure has been so designed that each story is pillared and is smaller than the other as you move upwards. While no less than 84 columns support the ground floor, the uppermost domed floor has only 4 columns. The whole structure is very airy and was styled to give respite from the scorching summers of Agra.</p>
